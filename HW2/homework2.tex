{\Large Homework 2: Classification and Bias-Variance Trade-offs}\\
\end{center}

\subsection*{Introduction}

This homework is about classification and bias-variance trade-offs. In
lecture we have primarily focused on binary classifiers trained to
discriminate between two classes. In multiclass classification, we
discriminate between three or more classes.  Most of the material for Problem 1 and Problem 3, and all of the material for Problem 2 will be covered by the end of the Tuesday 2/8 lecture. The rest of the material will be covered by the end of the Thursday 2/10 lecture.  We encourage you to read
CS181 Textbook's Chapter 3 for more information on linear
classification, gradient descent, classification in the discriminative
setting (covers multiclass logistic regression and softmax), and
classification in the generative setting. Read Chapter 2.8 for more
information on the trade-offs between bias and variance.

As a general note, for classification problems we imagine that we have
the input matrix $\boldX \in \reals^{N \times D}$ (or perhaps they
have been mapped to some basis $\bm{\Phi}$, without loss of
generality) with outputs now ``one-hot encoded."  This means that if
there are~$K$ output classes, rather than representing the output
label $y$ as an integer~${1,2,\ldots,K}$, we represent $\boldy$ as a
``one-hot" vector of length~$K$. A ``one-hot" vector is defined as
having every component equal to 0 except for a single component which
has value equal to 1.  For example, if there are $K = 7$ classes and a
particular data point belongs to class 3, then the target vector for
this data point would be~$\boldy = [0,0,1,0,0,0,0]$.  We will define
$C_1$ to be the one-hot vector for the 1st class, $C_2$ for the 2nd
class, etc.  Thus, in the previous example $\boldy = C_3$. If there
are $K$ total classes, then the set of possible labels is $\{C_1
\ldots C_K \} = \{C_k\}_{k=1}^K$.  Throughout the assignment we will
assume that each label $\boldy \in \{C_k\}_{k=1}^K$ unless otherwise
specified. The most common exception is the case of binary classification
($K = 2$), in which case labels are the typical integers $y \in \{0, 1\}$.\\

In problems 1 and 3, you may use \texttt{numpy} or \texttt{scipy}, but
not \texttt{scipy.optimize} or \texttt{sklearn}. Example code given is
in Python 3.\\

\begin{problem}[Exploring Bias and Variance, 10 pts]
  In this problem, we will explore the bias and variance of a
  few different model classes when it comes to logistic regression.

  Consider the true data generating process $y \sim \text{Bern}(f(x)), f(x) = 0.4 \times \sin(1.2x) + 0.5$, where $x \in [-3, 3]$, and $y \in \{0,1\}$.
  Recall that for a given $x$, bias and variance are defined in terms of expectations \textit{over randomly drawn datasets} $D$
  from this underlying data distribution:
  \begin{align*}
  \text{Bias}[\hat{f}(x)] &= \mathbb{E}_D[\hat{f}(x)] - f(x)\\
  \text{Variance}[\hat{f}(x)] &= \mathbb{E}_D[(\hat{f}(x) - \mathbb{E}_D[\hat{f}(x)])^2]
  \end{align*}
  Here, $\hat{f}(x)$ is our estimator (learned through logistic
  regression on a given dataset $D$).  We will directly explore the
  bias-variance trade-off by drawing multiple such datasets and
  fitting different logistic regression models to each.  Remember that
  we, the modelers, do not usually see the true data distribution.
  Knowledge of the true $f(x)$ is only exposed in this problem to (1)
  make possible the simulation of drawing multiple datasets, and (2)
  to serve as a pedagogical tool in allowing verification of the true
  bias.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Consider the three bases $\phi_1(x) = [1, x]$, $\phi_2(x) = [1,
  x, x^2]$, $\phi_3(x) = [1, x, x^2, x^3, x^4, x^5]$.  For each
  of these bases, generate 10 datasets of size $N = 30$ using the
  starter code provided, and fit a logistic regression model using
  sigmoid($w^T \phi(x)$) to each dataset by using gradient descent to
  minimize the negative log likelihood.  This means you will be
  running gradient descent 10 times for each basis, once for each
  dataset.  Note that the classes are represented with 0's and 1's.
  
  Use random starting values of $w$, $\eta=0.001$, take 10,000 update
  steps for each gradient descent run, and make sure to average the
  gradient over the data points (for each step). These parameters,
  while not perfect, will ensure your code runs in a reasonable amount
  of time. The emphasis of this problem is on capturing the
  bias-variance trade-off, so don't worry about attaining perfect
  precision in the gradient descent as long as this trade-off is
  captured in the final models.

   Note: Overflow RuntimeWarnings due to \verb|np.exp| should be safe to ignore, if any. Also, to reduce stress from randomness in students' solutions (due to randomized weight initialization differences), in line $109$ of the \verb|T2_P1.py| starter code, we call \verb|np.random.seed(1738)| to set a deterministic random seed. Please do not change this! In addition, please do not change the randomized weight initialization code in lines $42-46$.

\item Create three plots, one for each basis. Starter code is available which you may modify.
By default, each plot displays three types of functions:
(1) the true data-generating distribution $f(x)$ (the probability that $y=1$ for different $x$).
(2) all 10 of the prediction functions learned from each randomly drawn dataset, and
(3) the mean of the 10 prediction functions.
Moreover, each plot also displays 1 of the randomly generated datasets and highlights the corresponding prediction function learned by this dataset.

\item How are bias and variance reflected in the 3 types of curves on
  the graphs?  How do the fits of the individual and mean prediction
  functions change?  Keeping in mind that none of the model classes
  match the true generating process exactly, discuss the extent to
  which each of the bases approximates the true process.

  Note: In this problem, we are not interested in whether the model is
  more biased for certain inputs $x$ compared to other inputs $x'$.
  We are interested in the overall bias and variance of $\hat{f}(x)$
  across the different basis choices. In other words, we want to investigate how the bias between $\hat{f}(x)$ and the ground truth as well as the variance of $\hat{f}(x)$ will be different over different basis choices. 

\item If we were to increase the size of each dataset drawn from $N = 30$ to a larger number, how would the variance change? The bias?   Why might this be the case?

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Completed.
    \item Plots are below 
    \begin{figure} [h!]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{HW2/Basis 1.png}

        \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{HW2/Basis 3.png}
    \end{figure}
    \\ \\ \\ 
    \item We see that in basis $\phi_1$, our mean of learned models as well as our model learned from the displayed dataset has the highest bias but the lowest variance compared to the other bases. \\
    In basis $\phi_2$, our mean of learned models has even lower variance than that of $\phi_2$ and a slightly lower bias as well than that of $\phi_1$, while the same comparision holds for the model learned from the displayed dataset. We see that while model learned from the displayed dataset is very close to the mean of models for basis $\phi_1$, in basis $\phi_2$ our displayed model has greater bias as opposed to the mean of models. \\
    Finally, in basis $\phi_3$, our mean of learned models has a much lower bias compared to $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ while consequently having a much larger variance than $\phi_1$ or $\phi_2$. We also see that the same comparision holds for the model learned from the displayed dataset as opposed to those of $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$, and that our model learned from the displayed dataset in $\phi_3$ matches the mean model fairly closely (but still has higher bias and variance as compared to the mean). \\
    Altogether, we see that $\phi_3$ best models the ground truth process, while $\phi_2$ is the second best and $\phi_1$ is the worst. 
    
    \item If we were to increase the size of each dataset, each model would be trained on more data and would get a better representation of the ground truth function. Thus, for individual models of all bases, I would expect the variance to decrease and expect bias to decrease since they are able to better model the ground truth process. \\
    However, I do not think variance or bias would change after we average our models to get the mean of learned models. By taking the average of 10 models, our overall model has been able to learn from a good representation of the ground truth process (being effectively trained on 300 data points ranging from -3 to 3). While our induvidual models more accurately model the ground truth process, each model is now closer to mean of learned models (and there is less diversity from one model to the next for the same basis). Therefore, I think that increasing the data individual models see would not change the bias or variance of the mean of learned models.

\begin{problem}[Maximum likelihood in classification, 15pts]

  Consider now a generative $K$-class model.  We adopt class prior
  $p(\boldy = C_k; \bpi) = \pi_k$ for all $k \in \{1, \ldots, K\}$
(where $\pi_k$ is a parameter of the prior).
Let  $p(\boldx|\boldy=C_k)$ denote
the class-conditional density of features $\boldx$ (in this
case for class $C_k$). Consider the data set $D = \{(\boldx_i,
\boldy_i)\}_{i=1}^n$ where as above $\boldy_i \in \{C_k\}_{k=1}^K$ is
encoded as a one-hot target vector and the data are independent.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Write out the log-likelihood of the data set, $\ln p(D ; \bpi)$.

  \item Since the prior forms a distribution, it has the constraint that
    $\sum_k\pi_k - 1 = 0$.  Using the hint on
Lagrange multipliers below, give the
    expression for the maximum-likelihood estimator for the prior
    class-membership probabilities, i.e.
    $\hat \pi_k.$
    Make sure to write out the intermediary equation you need
    to solve to obtain this estimator. Briefly state why your final answer is intuitive.
\end{enumerate}

    For the remaining questions, let the
    class-conditional probabilities be Gaussian distributions with
the same covariance matrix
    $$p(\boldx | \boldy = C_k) = \mathcal{N}(\boldx |  \bmu_k, \bSigma), \text{\ for\ }k \in \{1,\ldots, K\}$$
    and different means $\bmu_k$ for each class.

    \begin{enumerate}
  \item[3.] Derive the gradient of the log-likelihood with respect to vector $\bmu_k$.
    Write the expression in matrix form as a function of the variables defined
    throughout this exercise. Simplify as much as possible for full credit.
  \item[4.] Derive the maximum-likelihood estimator $\hat{\mu}_k$ for vector $\bmu_k$. Briefly state why your final answer is intuitive.
  \item[5.] Derive the gradient for the log-likelihood with respect to the
    covariance matrix $\bSigma$ (i.e., looking
to find an MLE for the covariance).
Since you are differentiating with respect to a
    \emph{matrix}, the resulting expression should be a matrix!
%
  \item[6.] Derive the maximum likelihood estimator $\hat{\Sigma}$ of the covariance matrix.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Hint: Lagrange Multipliers.} Lagrange Multipliers are a method for
optimizing a function $f$ with respect to an
equality constraint, i.e.
\[\min_{\boldx} f(\boldx)\ \text{s.t.}\ g(\boldx) = 0.\]

This can be turned into an unconstrained problem by introducing a
Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ and constructing the Lagrangian function,
\[L(\boldx, \lambda) =  f(\boldx) + \lambda g(\boldx).\]

It can be shown that it is a necessary condition that the optimum
is a critical point of this new function. We can find this point by solving two equations:

\[\frac{\partial L(\boldx, \lambda)}{\partial  \boldx} = 0  \ \ \text{and}\  \  \frac{\partial L(\boldx, \lambda)}{\partial \lambda} = 0 \]


\paragraph{Cookbook formulas.} Here are some formulas you might want to consider
using to compute difficult gradients. You can use them  in the homework
without proof. If you are looking to hone your matrix calculus skills, try to
find different ways to prove these formulas yourself (will not be part of the
evaluation of this homework). In general, you can use any formula from the matrix cookbook,
as long as you cite it. We opt for the following common notation:
$\boldX^{-\top} := (\boldX^{\top})^{-1}$
\begin{align*}
  & \frac{\partial \bolda^\top \boldX^{-1} \boldb}{\partial \boldX} = - \boldX^{-\top} \bolda \boldb^\top \boldX^{-\top} \\
  & \frac{\partial \ln | \det (\boldX) |}{\partial \boldX} = \boldX^{-\top}
 \end{align*}
 \end{problem}


\subsection*{Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Given our input dataset, let $y_{i,k}$ denote the $k^{th}$ element of output vector $y_i$. We know that $y_{i,k} \in \{0, 1\}$ since $y_i$ is one-hot encoded, such that we only multiply unique terms to our product when 
    \begin{align}
        p(D; \pi) &= \prod_{i=1}^n p(y_i) \ p(x_i | y_i)  = \prod_{i=1}^n \prod_{k=1}^K (\pi_k \ p(x_i | y_i = C_k))^{y_{i,k}} \\
        \ln(p(D; \pi)) &= \ln(\prod_{i=1}^n \prod_{k=1}^K (\pi_k \ p(x_i | y_i = C_k))^{y_{i,k}}) \\
        &= \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^K (y_{i,k}\ln(\pi_k) + y_{i,k}\ln(p(x_i | y_i = C_k))
    \end{align}
    
    \item
    Let $g(\pi_k) = \sum_k \pi_k - 1$. We want to use our Langrange multipliers framework to optimize 
    \begin{align}
        L(\pi_k, \lambda) &= \ln(p(D; \pi) + \lambda g(\pi_k) \\
        &= \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^K (y_{i,k}\ln(\pi_k) + y_{i,k}\ln(p(x_i | y_i = C_k)) + \lambda \sum_{k=1}^K \pi_k - 1
    \end{align}
     It follows that
     \begin{align}
         \frac{\partial L}{\partial\pi_k}&= \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{y_{i,k}}{\pi_k} + \lambda = 0 \\
         &\implies  \pi_k = \frac{-1}{\lambda}\sum_{i=1}^n y_{i,k} =  \frac{-z_k}{\lambda}
     \end{align}
     where $z_k$ is the total sum of data points for which our corresponding label is class $k$.
     \begin{align}
         \frac{\partial L}{\partial\lambda}&= \sum_{k=1}^K \pi_k - 1 = 0 \\
         &\implies  \sum_{k=1}^K \pi_k = 1
     \end{align}
     Substituting in our two derivatives, we find that
     \begin{align}
         \sum_{k=1}^K \pi_k = \sum_{k=1}^K \frac{-z_k}{\lambda} = 1 \implies \lambda = -\sum_{k=1}^K z_k = -n
     \end{align}
     since the sum of $z_k$ over all $k$ classes implies that we have covered all possible data points. We can now substitute this value for $\lambda$ to find our MLE for $\pi_k$:
     $$\hat\pi_k = \frac{z_k}{n}$$
     This answer is intuitive since the number of datapoints which are assigned to each class divided by the total number of datapoints is a logical way to form our class prior estimation, since we have no reason to believe that test data will be biased for/against some class as opposed to our training data. 
     \item Let input vectors $x_i \in \reals^P$, such that $$p(x_i | y_i = C_k) = \mathcal{N}(x_i |  \mu_k, \Sigma) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{\frac{P}{2}}|\Sigma|^\frac{1}{2}}\exp(-\frac{1}{2}(x_i- \mu_k)^T\Sigma^{-1}(x_i-\mu_k))$$
     Then, observe that
     \begin{align}
         \nabla_{\mu_k}\ln(p(D;\pi)) &= \nabla_{\mu_k}(\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^K (y_{i,k}\ln(\pi_k) + y_{i,k}\ln(\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{\frac{P}{2}}|\Sigma|^\frac{1}{2}}\exp(-\frac{1}{2}(x_i- \mu_k)^T\Sigma^{-1}(x_i-\mu_k)))) \\
         &= \nabla_{\mu_k}(\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^K (y_{i,k}\ln(\pi_k) + y_{i,k}\ln(\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{\frac{P}{2}}|\Sigma|^\frac{1}{2}}) + y_{i,k}(-\frac{1}{2}(x_i- \mu_k)^T\Sigma^{-1}(x_i-\mu_k))) \\
         &= \sum_{i=1}^n\frac{-y_{i,k}}{2} \frac{\partial (x_i- \mu_k)^T\Sigma^{-1}(x_i-\mu_k)}{\partial \mu_k}
     \end{align}
     We can use property (85) in the ``Matrix Cookbook" to differentiate above. This requires that $\Sigma^{-1}$ be symmetric, ie $\Sigma^{-1} = \Sigma^{-T}$. \\
     \textbf{Aside: } 
     \begin{itemize}
         \item Since $Cov(A,B) = E[(A-E[A])(B-E[B])] =  E[(B-E[B])(A-E[A])] = Cov(B,A)$, we see that $\Sigma$ is symmetric ($\Sigma = \Sigma^T$).
         \item Next, we need to prove that if square invertible matrix $A = A^T$, then $A^{-T} = A^{-1}$. \\
         \textit{Proof: } Let square invertible matrix $A = A^T$. Then, multiply by $A^-1$ on the right sides, then transpose both sides, and then multiplying by $A^-1$ on the right sides again.
         \begin{align}
             A A^{-1} &= A^T A^{-1} \\
             I &= A^T A^{-1} \\
            \implies I^T &= (A^T A^{-1})^T \\
             I &= A^{-T} A \\
             \implies I A^{-1} &= A^{-T} A A^{-1} \\
             A^{-1} &= A^{-T}
         \end{align}
         It follows that since $\Sigma$ is symmetric, then $\Sigma^{-1}$ is also symmetric. 
     \end{itemize}
     This allows us to use property (85) in the ``Matrix Cookbook" to differentiate above. Then,
     \begin{align}
         \nabla_{\mu_k}\ln(p(D;\pi)) &= \sum_{i=1}^n\frac{-y_{i,k}}{2} 2 \Sigma^{-1}(x_i - \mu_k) = -\sum_{i=1}^ny_{i,k} \Sigma^{-1}(x_i - \mu_k)
     \end{align}
     \item 
     \begin{align}
         -\sum_{i=1}^n y_{i,k} \Sigma^{-1}(x_i - \mu_k) &= 0 \\
         \implies \sum_{i=1}^n y_{i,k} \Sigma^{-1} (x_i) &= \sum_{i=1}^n y_{i,k} \Sigma^{-1} (\mu_k) \\
         \implies \hat\mu_k &= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N y_{i,k}x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^N y_{i,k}} =  \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N y_{i,k}x_i}{z_k}
     \end{align}
     where $z_k$ (as previously defined) is the total sum of data points out of $n$ for which our corresponding label is class $k$. \\
     This MLE is equal to the average of all data points assigned to class $k$, which is an intuitive way to describe the mean of a Gaussian distribution!
     \item 
     \begin{align}
         \nabla_{\Sigma}\ln(p(D;\pi)) &= \nabla_{\Sigma}(\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^K (y_{i,k}\ln(\pi_k) + y_{i,k}\ln(\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{\frac{P}{2}}|\Sigma|^\frac{1}{2}}\exp(-\frac{1}{2}(x_i- \mu_k)^T\Sigma^{-1}(x_i-\mu_k)))) \\
         &= \nabla_{\Sigma}(\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^K (y_{i,k}\ln(\pi_k) + y_{i,k}\ln(\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{\frac{P}{2}}})- \frac{y_{i,k}}{2}\ln(|\Sigma|) - \frac{y_{i,k}}{2}(x_i- \mu_k)^T\Sigma^{-1}(x_i-\mu_k)) \\
     \end{align}
     Using the given Cookbook formulas at the bottom of the problem 2's page, it follows that 
     \begin{align}
         \nabla_{\Sigma}\ln(p(D;\pi)) &= \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^K -\frac{y_{i,k}}{2}\Sigma^{-T} + \frac{y_{i,k}}{2}\Sigma^{-T}(x_i-\mu_k)(x_i-\mu_k)^T\Sigma^{-T} \\
         &= -\frac{N}{2} \Sigma^{-T} + \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^K \frac{y_{i,k}}{2}\Sigma^{-T}(x_i-\mu_k)(x_i-\mu_k)^T\Sigma^{-T}
     \end{align}
     where $n$ is the total number of input-output pairs.
     \item Observe that we can multiply our for $\nabla_{\Sigma}\ln(p(D;\pi))$ by $\Sigma^T$ on both left-hand sides and by $\Sigma^T$ on both right hand sides and left hand sides. 
     \begin{align}
         &-\Sigma^T \frac{n}{2} \Sigma^{-T} \Sigma^T + \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^K \frac{y_{i,k}}{2}\Sigma^T\Sigma^{-T}(x_n - \mu_k)(x_n-\mu_k)^T\Sigma^{-T}\Sigma^T = 0 \\
         &\implies \frac{n}{2} \Sigma^T = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^K \frac{y_{i,k}}{2}(x_n - \mu_k)(x_n-\mu_k)^T \\
        &\implies \Sigma^T = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^K y_{i,k}(x_n - \mu_k)(x_n-\mu_k)^T
     \end{align}
     Since $\Sigma^T = \Sigma$ by definition of symmetry, we see that
     $$\hat\Sigma = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^K y_{i,k}(x_n - \mu_k)(x_n-\mu_k)^T$$

\begin{problem}[Classifying Stars, 15pts]

You're tasked with classifying three different kinds of stars using their magnitudes and temperatures. See star.png for a plot of
the data, adapted from
\url{http://astrosci.scimuze.com/stellar_data.htm} and available as
\verb|data/hr.csv|, which you will find in the Github repository. \\

The CSV file has three columns: type, magnitude, and temperature. The
first few lines look like this:
\begin{csv}
Type,Magnitude,Temperature
Dwarf,-5.8,-0.35
Dwarf,-4.1,-0.31
...
\end{csv}

In this problem, you will code up 4 different classifiers for this task:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]

\item \textbf{A three-class generalization of logistic regression},
  also known as softmax regression, in which you implement gradient
  descent on the negative log-likelihood. In Question 2 you will
  explore the effect of using different values for the learning rate
  $\eta$ (\texttt{self.eta}) and regularization strength $\lambda$
  (\texttt{self.lam}).  Make sure to include a bias term and to use L2
  regularization. See CS181 Textbook's Chapter 3.6 for details on  multi-class logistic regression and softmax. For your implementation, use the loss and gradient expressions provided there.

\item \textbf{A generative classifier with Gaussian class-conditional
  densities with a \textit{shared covariance} matrix} across all classes. 
  Feel free to re-use your Problem 2 results.
\item \textbf{Another generative classifier with Gaussian class-conditional densities , but now 
with a \textit{separate covariance} matrix} learned for each class. (Note: 
The staff implementation can switch between the two Gaussian generative classifiers with just a
few lines of code.)

\item \textbf{A kNN classifier} in which you classify based on the $k=1,3,5$ nearest neighbors and the following distance function: $$dist(star_1, star_2) = ((mag_1 - mag_2)/3)^2 + (temp_1 - temp_2)^2$$
where nearest neighbors are those with the smallest distances from a given point.

  Note 1: When there are more than two labels, no label may have the
  majority of neighbors.  Use the label that has the most votes among
  the neighbors as the choice of label. 

  Note 2: The grid of points for which you are making predictions
  should be interpreted as our test space.  Thus, it is not necessary
  to make a test point that happens to be on top of a training point
  ignore itself when selecting neighbors.

\end{enumerate}

After implementing the above classifiers, complete the following exercises:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Plot the decision boundaries generated by each classifier for the dataset. Include them in your PDF. 
    Identify the similarities and differences among the classifiers. What explains the differences?

    \item For logistic regression only, make a plot with ``Number of
      Iterations" on the x-axis and ``Negative Log-Likelihood Loss" on
      the y-axis for several configurations of the hyperparameters
      $\eta$ and $\lambda$.  Specifically, try the values $0.05$,
      $0.01$, and $0.001$ for each hyperparameter.  Limit the number
      of gradient descent iterations to 200,000.  What are your final
      choices of learning rate ($\eta$) and regularization strength
      ($\lambda$), and why are they reasonable? How does altering
      these hyperparameters affect the ability to converge, the rate
      of convergence, and the final loss (a qualitative description is
      sufficient)? You only need to submit one plot for your final
      choices of hyperparameters.

      Note: The \emph{likelihood} of the model is the probability of
      data given the model---it should not include the regularization
      term.  The \emph{objective} is the combination of the likelihood
      and the regularizer.
      
    \item For both Gaussian generative models, report the negative log-likelihood loss. Which model has a lower loss, and why?
      For the separate covariance model, be sure to use
      the covariance matrix that matches the true class of each data
      point.
    
    \item Consider a star with Magnitude 6 and Temperature 2.
      To what class does each classifier assign this star? Do the
      classifiers give any indication as to whether or not you should
  trust them?

\noindent\textbf{Problem 3} (cont.)\\


\textbf{Implementation notes:} Run the controller file, \texttt{T2\_P3.py},
to test your code. Write the actual implementations in the \texttt{GaussianGenerativeModel},
\texttt{LogisticRegression}, and \texttt{KNNModel} classes, which are defined in the three
\texttt{T2\_P3\_ModelName.py} files. These classes follow the same interface pattern
as sklearn. Their code
currently outputs nonsense predictions just to show the
high-level interface, so you should replace their \texttt{predict()} implementations.
You'll also need to modify the hyperparameter
values in \texttt{T2\_P3.py} for logistic regression.

    For the generative result with shared covariances and softmax, we see that linear boundaries between classes, whereas for separate covariances we see curved boundaries which fit more tightly to each class. \\
    This makes sense for the softmax regression, since it is a multi-dimensional implementation of linear regression. If we assume that there is a separate covariance matrix (which describes the shape of our multivariate Gaussian distribution) for each class when ``generating" our inputs, our multivariate gaussian will have biased insight into how our data is generated and our class boundary will be closely shaped near our training data for each class. Meanwhile, a shared covariance considers a more holistic view of how data is generated, and this common covariance leads to linear boundaries. \\
    Finally, for our knn result, we see that our decision boundaries are fairly nonlinear, since they are decided based off of the closest neighbors based on our distance function. Given that our distance function weights temperature more heavily than magnitude, we see that as the number of neighbors we consider increases, our boundaries become more vertical (since temperature is on the vertical axis in our plots). \\
    Altogether, we see that for regions where there is little data, based on whether considering probablistic interpretations to classification or nearest neighbors, our classifiers seem to extrapolate differently. For instance, logistic regression and shared covariance generative classification predicts that large magnitude and high temperature stars are ''Giants" whereas the other models predict that these stars are ``Dwarfs."

    \item 
    After trying values for $\eta = 000.1, 0.01, 0.05$ and $\lambda = 0.001, 0.01, 0.05$, I have found that my final choices for learning rate and regularization strength are $\eta = 0.01$ and $\lambda = 0.01$. These are reasonable parameters because they lead to minimizing the loss the fastest out of the 9 plots while still driving the loss to zero. Furthermore, a relatively large $\lambda$ ensures that our weights are not too large, whereas a relatively large $\eta$ values ensures that we converge to minimize our loss quickly. \\


    As $\eta$ increases, our gradient descent can more aggressively work towards minimizing loss and converging to some zero value. This means a faster rate of convergence and minimizing the loss towards $0$ as much as we can. \\
    Meanwhile, as $\lambda$ increases, our rate of convergence also increases in most settings. Since we limit weights from being too large, so long as our gradient descent can minimize this new loss-regularization gradient term and drive loss to zero, our weights being smaller can lead to a faster rate of convergence. However, regularization can sometimes lead to our error not converging at all. One example is for the case $\eta = 0.05, \lambda = 0.05$, where the logistic regression loss oscillates between approximately 0 and 20. 
    
    \item The shared covariance Gaussian model has loss of $137.74$, while the separate covariance Gaussian model has loss of $123.23$. \\
    The covariance matrix describes the shape of our multivariate Gaussian distribution. If we assume that there is a separate covariance for each class when ``generating" our inputs, our multivariate gaussian will have biased insight into how our data is generated and our class boundary will be closely shaped near our training data for each class. This closer fit can lead to lower loss. Meanwhile, a shared covariance considers a more holistic view of how data is generated.
    
    \item 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Separate Covariance Gaussian Model: 0 
        \item Shared Covariance Gaussian Model: 1
        \item Softmax: 1
        \item KNN Model with k=1: 0
        \item KNN Model with k=3: 0
        \item KNN Model with k=5: 0
    \end{itemize}
    The classifiers can give some insights into how much we should trust them. For instance, for KNN, the more neighbors that are the same as the label, the greater our confidence in our prediction (this approach doesn't work if $k=1$). Meanwhile, we can look at how high the probability of the Softmax prediction for the chosen class is relative to the other class predicted probabilities for confidence in this classifier: the higher the prediction probability relative to others, the greater our confidence in the classifier's prediction. Finally, we can look at how the probability of the Gaussian classifiers for the chosen class is relative to the other class predicted probabilities for confidence in this classifier: the higher the prediction probability relative to others, the greater our confidence in the classifier's prediction.
